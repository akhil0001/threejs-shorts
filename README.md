# three-js-shorts
- A collection of shorts / shots built using three js. These are code snippets that are coded in 1-3 hours and are short and subtle, hence the name `three-js-shorts`
- This is not any form of library or tutorial.

### Ichi-ni
- A puzzle game [*work in progress*]
- Explores physics engines and collisions, keyframes in animations
- Stack: `cannon.js`, `three.js` , `anime.js`
